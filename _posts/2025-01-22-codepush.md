At GovWizely, we sometimes run into issues with our clients when we ask the simple question: How much code have you pushed to Production today? last week? last month? In today's world it is easy to get bogged down with buzzwords. (Does anyone know what the world agile means anymore?) Regardless, of the existing policies and procederes that exist we at GovWizely strive to push code to Production that matters.
