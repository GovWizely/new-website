# What Is a Co-Pilot Use Case?

The ChatGPT usage shows the demand for "co-pilot" applications. While the US government has banned the use of public ChatGPT to do government work, the burden now shifts to organizations to provide domain specific ChatpGPT-like functionality to empower their employees.  

Co-pilot applications are Large Language Models (LLMs) created with domain specific content to provide your employees the AI tools available on their to make them more, not less, productive. These use cases include, but are not limited to, data analytics, report writing, and domain specific suggestions.

## Preparation

To incorporate a co-pilot application into your organization, you must first prepare your data for ingestion into an LLM. As many organizations store their information in separate silos, this process can be combined with other initiatives, such as knowledge management or enterprise search projects.

## Third Party / Licensed Content  

Have you licensed information or data from other vendors? Planning and integrating licensed content into your Co-pilot applications will further train and customize your LLM and allow your organization to maximize its investments in third party content.

## Public Information Is Still Useful

Your organization or your employees likely leverages public information as a part of doing their job.  Leveraging relevant public information will increase the content to aid your LLM use case.

# Secure Co-Pilots

Organizations that provide Co-Pilots for their employees may rest assured that the content  used to generate the LLM is approved by management, the software resides in their organizations cloud tenant, and the employee's queries will be sent over the Internet to commercial software companies.
